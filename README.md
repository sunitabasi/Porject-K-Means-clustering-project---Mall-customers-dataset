# Project-K-Means-clustering-project---Mall-customers-dataset
**Mall customers datset analaysis**

This project analysis the mall customers on the basis of age, their annual income, gender and spending habit. This analysis uses Kmeans clustering method to analyze and understand relationships between the variables and visualizing the cluster dividion.

**Usage**
Explore and preprocess dataset, load mall_customers.csv dataset, perform data preprocessing to prepare the data for clustering. Steps involved: normalization of data, encoding categorical variables,handle outliners, Exploratory data analysis- univariate, bivariate analysis, divide the datas in bins, rescaling of data and spliting the dataset in training and testing sets. Train KMeans clustering model and evaluate and visaulize the data.

**Results**
It provides comprehensive approach to applying K-Means clustering on the Mall Customers dataset, visualizing the clusters, and understanding the segmentation of customers based on their income level, age and spending behavior. It helps to divide the customers on the basis of clusters.
